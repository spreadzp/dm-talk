This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
https://dm-talk.vercel.app/

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# Particle Auth, Account Abstraction SDK, Next.js, ethers V6 

## Table of contents

 
Built using:

- **Particle Authkit**
- **Particle AA SDK**
- **ethers.js V6.x.x**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**

 
## üîë Particle Auth

Particle Auth, a component of Particle Network's Wallet-as-a-Service, enables seamless onboarding to an application-embedded MPC-TSS/AA wallet facilitated by social login, such as Google, GitHub, email, phone number, etc.

üëâ Learn more about [Particle Auth](https://developers.particle.network/docs/building-with-particle-auth).

## ü™™ Account Abstraction SDK

Particle Network natively supports and facilitates the end-to-end utilization of ERC-4337 account abstraction. This is primarily done through the account abstraction SDK, which can construct, sponsor, and send UserOperations, deploy smart accounts, retrieve fee quotes, and perform other vital functions.

> Every gasless transaction is automatically sponsored on testnet. On mainnet, you'll need to deposit USDT into Paymaster.
